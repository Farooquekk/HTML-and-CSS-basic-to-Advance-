        <p>An economic analysis method is a structured approach used to study economic phenomena and make informed decisions. It involves applying tools and frameworks to analyze costs, benefits, risks, and trade-offs associated with different choices. Common methods include cost-benefit analysis, regression analysis, and supply and demand analysis.

                <h4>For-Profit Decision Analysis </h4>
                <p> <ul><i>Explanation:</i></ul>  For-profit decision analysis involves evaluating potential investments or actions to determine their potential profitability for the business. It considers both the revenue expected to be generated from the investment and the costs associated with undertaking it. By comparing the expected profits to the costs, businesses can make informed decisions about whether to proceed with an investment.

                <h4>Minimum Acceptable Rate of Return            </h4>
                <p> <ul><i>Explanation:</i></ul> The minimum acceptable rate of return (MARR) is the minimum rate of return that an investment must achieve to justify the risk associated with it. It is often used as a benchmark for evaluating investment opportunities, with investments expected to generate returns higher than the MARR considered acceptable.

                <h4>Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)            </h4>
                <p> <ul><i>Explanation:</i></ul> ROCE measures how efficiently a company is using its capital to generate profits. It is calculated by dividing the company's operating profit by the capital employed, which includes both equity and debt capital.

                <h4>Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)            </h4>
                <p> <ul><i>Explanation:</i></ul> Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is a systematic approach to evaluating the costs and benefits of a decision or project. It involves identifying and quantifying all relevant costs and benefits associated with the decision, both monetary and non-monetary, and comparing them to determine whether the benefits outweigh the costs.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Cost-Effectiveness Analysis       </h4>
                <p> <ul><i>Explanation:</i></ul> Cost-effectiveness analysis compares the costs of achieving a particular outcome with the effectiveness of different approaches. It helps decision-makers identify the most efficient way to achieve their objectives by comparing the costs of alternative interventions or strategies.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Break-Even Analysis        </h4>
                <p> <ul><i>Explanation:</i></ul>Break-even analysis calculates the point at which total revenue equals total costs, resulting in neither profit nor loss. It helps businesses determine the level of sales or production needed to cover their costs and start generating profits.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Business Case     </h4>
                <p> <ul><i>Explanation:</i></ul>A business case presents the rationale for a proposed investment or project, providing an analysis of the costs, benefits, risks, and expected outcomes. It helps decision-makers evaluate the potential return on investment and make informed decisions about whether to proceed with the project.
